# diagrams/

These are some diagrams I'll use for creating concepts of ideas. These do not constitute a final API, they are simply a starter for one.

To render these, make sure you:
 * Install [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com)
 * Install (and configure as necessary) [GraphViz](https://www.graphviz.org/)
 * Use some way to render the diagrams, whether it's with an IDE plugin, browser plugin, or local executable.
