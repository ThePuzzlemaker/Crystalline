It also causes the most insanity in this mod (without addons, excluding the $(l:crystals/rift_crystal)Rift Crystal$(/l)). If you use it in the mode \"Administration\", you can push a player a bit in the direction you are looking, or if you use it while sneaking, you can harm a player by roughly 1.5 hearts."

Hurting a player will cost 25% insanity, 10% potential, and an $(l:reagents/extreme_reagent)Extreme Reagent$(/l). The Administration Crystal is a bound crystal, so whoever it is bound to will be affected. See $(l:information/rebinding)Rebinding$(/l) for more information."
